# AMY: A Meal by You

AMY is an innovative food bank app designed by keeping SNUâ€™s current mess ecosystem in consideration. AMY allows the students to make efficient use of their about to be lapsed mess card balance by making meal donations for the people for whom affording the meals is not that simple, eg. gardeners, nurserymen, guards working in night shifts etc.

AMY helps in efficient exhaustion of the almost lapsing mess card balance while making an effort to encourage the value of sharing among the student community and makes it more caring. It even gives a sense of warmth to the workers who then would feel more attached to their workplace.
